# Student Management API
This is a simple API that that is used internally at [Steampunk Education](https://www.steampunk.education) to manage the student's contact info. As the CEO of Steampunk Education, I am working on making all our internal & external software open-source, that way we are open and honest about what kind of customer data we ingest.

The API was built using the Spring Web framework. Spring Data JPA was used to for the database management layer.
